## Okta OpenID Examples

Here you will find some examples on how to use Okta's OpenID feature to secure your web applications.
Those examples were written using Ruby on Rails.

I strongly suggest that you also check the example Python implementation (and documentation) made by one of Okta's developers. You can check it [here](https://github.com/jpf/okta-oidc-beta).

### Getting started

  - Adding a new application to Okta`
  - Configuring OpenID
  - Redirecting unauthenticated users to Okta
  - Handling successful authentication
  - Validating ID Token (JWT)`

  #### Adding a new application to Okta

### Example 1: Using OpenID with browser based authentication

The source code for this demo is available inside the folder `rails-app`.

This example shows how to authenticate with Okta without using a browser.

The source code for this demo is available inside the folder `rails-api`.
